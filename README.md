# Digital Rolodex ðŸ“‡

### About the project

I'm a popular person. I've always been a popular person. In fact, I've been popular for so long that I don't have all my contacts saved digitally. In fact, I'm *so* old-fashioned I have some of my contacts in a rolodex, which, unfortunately, just broke. That's actually why I'm here, it's time to write a new chapter in my life! By writing code!

The goal is to take contacts found on a "rolodex" and put them in a computer.

1. Each contact has a single-space separated First Name (or initial), optional Middle Name (or initial), and Last Name (or initial)
2. A contact can have a nickname surrounded with quotes " "
3. A contact can have a telephone number
    * It will always have 10 digits
    * Separators are not necessary but, if there is a separator, the format will always be: `3 digits <separator> 3 digits <separator> 4 digits`
4. A contact can have an email address
5. A contact can have a birthdate
    * The separator is not constant, but there will be one between day, month and year
    * The day or day and month may not be present

### Installation
Installation is simple! 
1. Make sure you have Java 8 (or higher) installed [click here to learn how to do that](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/version_manual.xml) 
2. You will also need [Maven 3.2+](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
3. clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/GLeaden/digital-rolodex.git`
4. navigate to the newly downloaded project and run this command `./mvnw spring-boot:run` from the main directory
5. The server is now running on `localhost:8080`


* There are two main ways to interact with the API.
  * `POST` to `/contactdump/` and
  * `GET`/`PUT`/`POST` to `/contacts/`
    * There are also `findByLastName`, `findByNickname` and a few other `/contact/search/` options.

### How to use
Once you have the server up and running, the first thing you should do is:
* Add contacts.
  * Take a look at the example contacts below and copy/paste them into your favorite API development tool (Postman, cURL) with content type as `text/plain` on the endpoint `localhost:8080/contactdump/`
  * These contacts have now been loaded into the JPA repository and can be accessed with `GET` `/contacts/`.
  * From here you can play around with different HTTP verbs and even update existing contacts with `PUT`

### Example Contacts
Below are all *valid* contact entries.
```

### Purpose
This digital rolodex was created as part of a technical interview with an industry leading startup in the cloud governance sector. 

I challenged myself to use Spring Boot, a language used by said company but one I had never used before. I enjoyed the experience and would work with Spring Boot again. However if I started over knowing what I know now about Domain Driven Design I would have approached this project more strategically. Overall I hope this project and its commits effectively illustrate my thought process and my adaptability to learn new things.
